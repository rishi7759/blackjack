🃏 Blackjack Game

This is a simple Blackjack (21) game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game runs entirely in the browser and follows basic Blackjack rules, allowing the player to draw cards and try to reach a score of 21 without going over.

** How to Play**

To start the game, click the “Start Game” button. You can draw a new card by clicking the “New Card” button. The goal is to get a total card value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. If your score goes above 21, you lose the game.

** Features**

The game includes random card generation, automatic score calculation, win and lose conditions, and a simple, clean user interface. All game logic is handled using JavaScript, and no external libraries or backend services are required.

** Built With**

This project was built using HTML for the structure of the game, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for implementing the game logic and interactivity.


 How to Run Locally
